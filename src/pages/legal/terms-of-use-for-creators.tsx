          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Hi ðŸ‘‹</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">I'm Waveful, the creator-friendly social network where everyone can become a creator ðŸŒŠ</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Before diving in a more formal explanation of our Terms of Use for Creators, let me briefly tell you my mission ðŸš€</p>
          <p className="mb-4">My goal is to be a social network where everyone can share their passions and feel welcomed in a comfortable and positive environment; where creators can thrive and where users can enjoy original content, find new meaningful connections and have fun. I hope I'm doing well in this, but you be the judge!</p>
          <p className="mb-4">To allow the accomplishment of this mission I set some rules for everyone to follow, so I can provide a safe place for everyone.</p>
          <p className="mb-6">I hope you understand that these rules are here not for giving you any inconvenience but for allowing an enjoyable experience to every user.</p>
          <p className="mb-6">Therefore, content that can lead to a negative or harmful environment cannot be posted on Waveful.</p>
          <p className="mb-6">Now I'll leave you to a more formal explanation of my Terms of Use for Creators, and thanks for being here!</p>
